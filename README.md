**Hello, you can call me Auggie, Fiizzy, or whatever my skin is.**
*"I'll be waving my hand

*Watching you drown*

*Watching you scream*

*Quiet or loud"*
*I'm an aspiring writer, marine biologist and artist.* 

You can check out more about me on pateron.
Here is my shark research that is ongoing at the moment! [https://rentry.co/oxhkahci] 
Lastly here is basically me yapping about marine biology n shit [https://rentry.co/MarineBiologyStuff]


So I will do a quick summary of who I am!
Basically I am a want to be marine biologist, I don't have a specific field I study in yet because I am indecisive, My favourite fish is a vampire fish which I hope to catch one day. I really enjoy answering peoples questions about marine biology and I hope to find any other aspiring marine biologist!
