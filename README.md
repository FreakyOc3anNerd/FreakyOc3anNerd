Goodbye,


I will miss Ponytown & all the great memories I had with my friends + many others I interacted along the way.I might be active on (blackbridges) discord. I pushed many people out of my life due to my mental health increasingly getting worse & I am truly sorry for that. I don't know if I will ever be back or as active as before and to be honest if you know you know but I might not be here next year. If that does happen I want my friends to know it's not your fault nor is it anyone elses. I tried my whole life to make the people around me happy as can be. And I hope I made many smile. My whole goal on Ponytown was just to show that not everyone is toxic or bad, yeah we may have some ups & downs and might make some mistakes along the way but that doesn't make you a bad person. I hope everyone has a great life and make some memories while you still are living. It's going to be hard out there but if I made it this far I bet you can go further. I'm rooting for everyone to just live life like it can't stop you. This is not just a note for me leaving PonyTown, this is a note for me leaving for good. I am sorry if you seen this on a good day. I am sorry. I don't want anybody to be upset. Please just know I am happier this way, I don't want to fully say my intentions but I made it clear enough to understand. Have a greatday & make sure to spend time as much as possible with your friends and family. You might not realize now but friends and family leave fast so just spend time enjoying life. 

Bye, Salmon, Sen, Cross, GothicCowboy, Lula & many others.
